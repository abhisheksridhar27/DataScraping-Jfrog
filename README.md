Run the python script to save the files.

I was facing some issues in trying to retrieve the answers for the questions from the Stack Exchange API. So, I modified  the code to retrieve the answer URL and store it in the text file. The code includes the answer URL in the text file, allowing users to access the full answer by visiting the URL. Each question is saved in a separate text file with the corresponding answers.

The text files are stored in the RAR file.

Please give it a try, and let me know if it works as expected.
